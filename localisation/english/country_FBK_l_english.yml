FBK_idea_hillfolk_league_member:0 "Hillfolk League Member"
FBK_idea_hillfolk_league_member_desc:0 "This country is a member of the Hillfolk League."

EAW_WS_FBK:0 "Farbrook - Home of the Hillponies"
EAW_WS_FBK_desc:0 "In the far north-east of the Griffonian Continent, there lie many scattered settlements of ponies. The most northerly of these is Farbrook, a collection of villages and towns centered on the great (by northern standards) central city of Farbrook proper.\n\nIn 1007, the ponies of Farbrook are very worried. Though their leader, §YCenhelm§!, has proven capable, his seven-year stint as elected high chief is coming to a close, and the Grand Council will soon meet to choose who should be leader over all the villages. Cenhelm has an impressive record, but many factors are in play that could scuttle his chances at a second term. The most notable problems facing Farbrook can be grouped into two broad categories - §Yexternal danger§! and §Yinternal dissent.§! Farbrook is small, weak, and well aware of both of these facts, and its ponies are none too happy about that. We need to find some way to §Yprotect ourselves§!, whether this be through a §Ystrong military§! or through §Ymaking friends§! with others.\n\nThe internal threat is related to the external one - the fear of attack, and the knowledge of our vulnerability both make Farbrook ponies paranoid, and if the problem is not addressed quickly enough, they will be increasingly open to §Rradical voices§! who offer easy solutions. Both the §YNorth Eastern Socialist Party§! and the vicious, warlike §YWhite Hooves Clan§! offer solutions to this problem, both involving rapid militarisation and vigorous suppression of internal enemies. It is unlikely, but possible, that the §YCouncil could listen to them§! instead of Cenhelm. Even if they do not, danger would not be completely averted, as Cenhelm would then need to §Ydeal with them himself§! to ensure stability.\n\nFarbrook is surrounded mostly by neutral or friendly nations, and have an §Yespecially strong bond§! with the changelings of §YGreneclyf§!, across the sea. If anything were to happen to them, they would probably turn to us for help first. To the South lies the §YRiver Coalition.§! They see us as their long-lost cousins, and oughtn't be a threat, but nobody can be sure if they truly have our best interests at heart. Finally, to the south-west lies §RHellquill§!, the Griffon knightly order that has ravaged the eastern ponies for centuries. They are almost certain to end up as a threat, one way or another."
